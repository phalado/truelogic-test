# Truelogic test

This repo is a test done for Truelogic

The idea is to create codes in any language according to the client's specifications.

As I'm applying for a Ruby position I choose to do it using Ruby.

Three points need to be understood:

- While doing this test, I was not worried about working on the most efficient code - seeing that I was working with a small dat file - neither the most elegant one. I coded something simple with lots of comments only to show, easily, a way to implement the solution.
- These codes were created for the specific files dat files shared. You will see that some lines were skipped for being useless. Also, the soccer.dat file has a "-" line that I ignored because it would result in a 0-goal difference and it is virtually impossible for it to be the biggest value.
- Last but not least, it's possible to run these codes for different files adding the file path as an argument while calling it: ```ruby soccer.rb new_file.dat```

Have fun
